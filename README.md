# What's for Dinner?

## Overview
A user is given three different dish options to choose from: sides, main dish, and dessert.  When an option is selected, and the user clicks a button, a random recipe is displayed.  The user can then add that recipe to their list of favorite recipes by clicking on the ‚ù§Ô∏è button.  After adding the recipe, a list of all of the user's favorite recipes are displayed.  There are checkboxes next to each dish, and if the user selects a recipe, they can click the üíî button, which will remove the recipe from the list of favorites.  If they would like to go back to the recipe page, there is a back button for navigation.  The user can also choose to go directly to their list of favorites at any time by clicking on the "Favorite Recipes" button at the top of the page.
